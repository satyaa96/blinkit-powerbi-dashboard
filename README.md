## 🔍 Project Overview

In a competitive retail environment, data-driven decision-making is essential. This project simulates a real-world scenario where the management of a fast-growing online grocery delivery company (like Blinkit) wants to analyze its sales and outlet performance across locations.

Using a structured dataset and Power BI, this dashboard provides key insights such as:

The dashboard is fully interactive, with slicers and filters for exploring trends across multiple dimensions such as location, item type, and outlet size.
